            <h1>Constellations</h1>
            <p>This project is a python tool that takes several inputs from the user, and displays the desired stars and consteallations in a window and axis. Through the terminal, I was also able to direct certain txt files which contain different constellations and patterns, resulting in amazing differnt outputs</p>

            <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
            <p>
                This project is a game where a user faces off against simple AI in a round of tic-tac-toe. This project mainly encapsulates the concept of 2d lists and different operations within them.
